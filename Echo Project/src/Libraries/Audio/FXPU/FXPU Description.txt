Effects Processing Unit

Rack style effects processing. Will use other AUs and Plugins in this library. Will operate using normal signal flow rules (1 way processed in descending order).
Two different effects racks: 
- Bake: Bake the effects filters into the audio data that the Cook rack will use at runtime
- Cook: Cook effects on the fly. Done at run time and not prior to simulation
