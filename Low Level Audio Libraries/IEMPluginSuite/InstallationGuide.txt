INSTALLATION GUIDE

To install the plug-ins, simply move the ‚IEM‘ folder containing the VST-plug-ins to your VST plug-in folder. That folder is usually located here:

macOS: /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST or ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST
windows: C:\Programm Files\Steinberg\VstPlugins
Linux: /usr/lib/lxvst or /usr/local/lib/lxvst

You might need to restart your DAW before being able to use the plug-ins.

EXAMPLE: Preparing Reaper

The plug-ins were tested with the DAW Reaper. To use the feature of selectable Ambisonics order, Reaper has to inform the plug-ins about the current channel size. With version 5.80 Reaper automatically will do that! If you are using a previous Reaper version you have to configure this manually:

Open Reaper after installing the plug-ins
Open the plugin-browser (click the add button in the FX list of a channel)
Search for IEM, all the IEM plug-ins should now show up in the plugin-browser
Right-click and enable Inform plug-in when track channel count changes for each plugin
These steps only have to be done once, it will be enabled in every Reaper session. Already inserted plug-ins may be re-inserted to get affected by these changes.
